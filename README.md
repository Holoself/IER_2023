# Code to Explore the Relationship between Eye Blink Rate and Different Virtual Environments

This project aims to calculate the eye blink rate from original data,
and evaluate the differences between different groups. Furthermore,
visualize the eye blink data, and the correlation analyse results.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project is based on Python 3.9

In order to run the code, the following packages are needed:
- matplotlib == 3.7.1 
- numpy == 1.24.3
- pandas == 2.0.1
- scipy == 1.10.1
- seaborn == 0.12.2

### Installing

Be sure you have installed all the required packages before you run the Main.py

Otherwise, install the packages by pip command, for example,

    pip install seaborn

If you want to install a specific version of a package, use

    pip install seaborn==0.12.2

Be sure to install the correct version of packages, to prevent any version conflict.

You should put the data set on the root of this project, or just simply change the dir in the Main.py.


## Running the tests

In order to run the analysis, just simply open and run Main.py.

### Sample Tests

Run the Main.py with default settings, using your preferred IDE, or using the command,

    Python Main.py

Then, the figures will pop up, and the results of ANOVA test and post-test will returned.
